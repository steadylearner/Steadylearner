In this post, You will learn how to make a music video with a single image. You should have seen many music videos like that at [YouTube][YouTube]. You will find that you don't need complicated softwares to make them following this post. 

What you need is just **Python, audio and images files** to use. Before move on, I hope you already know how to  programming a little bit and have Python and pip installed in your machine. If it wasn't, that is ok. I will give you links below to help you. You may visit them.

You woudn't need **ImageMagick** and **youtube-dl** for this post if you already have audio and image files ready. You can skip the parts relevant to them if you want. I also included **How to extract audio from the video with Python** for it will help you understand this post better.

From now on, I will assume that you already made Python and pip work for your machine. Most of the time, Python will be already installed in your local machine. I hope you to use the lastest version of it to stay relevant to this posts.

## 1. Prepare audio with youtube-dl

<a title="Link to YouTube Video for this post" class="hover cursor-pointer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=s7TVVyTyReU
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/s7TVVyTyReU/0.jpg" 
alt="Your Love - The Outfield" width="100%" height="100%" border="10" /></a>


I hope you already made **youtube-dl** installed following the official documentation from **youtube-dl**. For it is not so difficult extract audio files from YouTube videos, we will use the python package to donwload YouTube and then extract it with Moviepy.

You can search videos at YouTube for the audio. Then you can use its videoId instead of placeholder below to donwload them.

```$youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<videoId>```

For example, You may test how it works with video above.
($youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7TVVyTyReU)

<br />

## 2. Edit image size with ImageMagik

![ImageMagik][ImageMagik]

For audio file is ready with the [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7TVVyTyReU) from the previous prcoess, we will prepare the image that will be used with it. I hope you already have any software for image edition unless you want to use ImageMagik or couldn't make it installed.

In this phase, We will make 640x360 image with ImageMagik for it works well with YouTube and other cases also.

`$convert -resize 640x360! your_image.ext result_image.ext`

ex) $conver -resize 640x360! image_from_the_web.jpeg resized_image.jpeg

and that is all. Your image is ready to be used for your music video with a single image.
(Use ! to force image resize, otherwise it will find the size to preserve image quality)

## 3.  Python code with Moviepy to make a music video

<br />

<br />

At this moment, You already have audio file and image file to use. What we need to do from now on is just to instruct your machine to make a video instead of you. We will use Python and Moviepy for that. 

**I hope you already visited its official website and read the documenation.**

The code snippet we need to write will be just a few lines of code below after all. After that you just need to execute it at command line.  Let me show you the code first.

<br />

**[Python Code]**

```python
# music_video_with_image.py
import os, sys
from moviepy.editor import *

audio = AudioFileClip(sys.argv[1])
image = ImageClip(sys.argv[2]).set_duration(audio.duration) 

video = image.set_audio(audio)
outfile = f"{os.path.splitext(sys.argv[1])[0]}_with_image.mp4" # 1.

video.write_videofile(outfile, fps=1)

# Use line below if you want to preserve the name of both files.
# 1. outfile = f"{os.path.splitext(sys.argv[1])[0]}_with_image_{os.path.splitext(sys.argv[2])[0]}.mp4"
```

<br />

First, we will import os, sys to handle file names for our preference and make use of CLI better. Then, `from moviepy.editor import *` to use every functions of Moviepy inside this file easily and we don't need other Python modules.

After that, we will write Python code on our own. I think that you can easily understand what is going on in the code snippet for they are just plain English.

Inside it, you are just assigning variables for each files that we prepared above and using Moviepy and Python native API to make a file with your preferred file name with `f"{your_preferred_video_filename_and.ext}` 

You may wonder what do sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2] mean. They are just used to indicate arguments that you will pass in the Command line later. You may find it more at [How to use sys.argv in Python](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiF7sPxmY7hAhV1ILkGHcHODyIQFjACegQIABAL&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pythonforbeginners.com%2Fsystem%2Fpython-sys-argv&usg=AOvVaw0R5P3WpDvi-MMdfy1q1YQQ)


You wouldn't need to tweak the example above if you want and use it directly. Before move on to the next phase. Just save it with file name such as music_video_with_image.py

<br />

**[Command Line]**

```
$python music_video_with_single_image.py <video_for_audio> <image>

ex) python music_video_with_image.py audio_from_video.mp4 your_image.jpg  
```


You almost made it. What you need to do is just type the command above in your Command Line. After that, You will see the process similar to snippet below and your video file will be ready to use.(You can see the video complete at [here](https://www.steadylearner.com/video/watch/s7TVVyTyReU))

<br />

```
$python image_with_audio.py The\ Outfields\ -\ I\ don\'t\ wanna\ lose\ your\ love\ tonight.webm outfiled-yourlove.jpeg
pygame 1.9.4
[MoviePy] >>>> Building video The Outfields - I don't wanna lose your love tonight_with_image_outfiled-yourlove.mp4
[MoviePy] Writing audio in The Outfields - I don't wanna lose your love tonight_with_image_outfiled-yourloveTEMP_MPY_wvf_snd.mp3
[MoviePy] Done.

<br />

I hope you made it. From now on, What you need to do will be just to modify some words in examples for your own project. You may upload the file at YouTube or use it to test Moviepy API. 

You can also find some of the example videos at [Steadylearner YouTube][YouTube]. They are made with almost the same process explained in this site.
